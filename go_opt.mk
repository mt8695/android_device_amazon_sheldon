# compared to quicken. Using quicken for shared APKs on Go devices may save RAM.
# Note that this is a trade-off: here we trade clean pages for dirty pages,
# extra cpu and battery. That's because the quicken files will be jit-ed in all
# the processes that load of shared apk and the code cache is not shared.
# Some notable apps that will be affected by this are gms and chrome.
